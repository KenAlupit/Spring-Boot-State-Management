# State Management using JSTL conversion to Spring Boot Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to transform a previous activity that utilized JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) into a Spring Boot application. The original activity allowed users to log in using one of four predefined credentials. Once logged in, users had the options to take an exam, check their grades, or log out.

When users choose to take the exam, they encounter five randomly shuffled questions with multiple-choice options. After completing the exam, users can view their total score and the percentage achieved. They are then presented with options to retake the exam or return to the main menu to check their updated grades.

Logging out from the application ensures that users cannot access previous pages without logging back in.
